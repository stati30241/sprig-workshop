# Sprig Workshop - Beginner Level

## Prerequisites
If you are at this workshop, you should already be familiar with the basic features of Sprig, as this workshop will dive straight into the more advanced stuff. If you haven't already, go check out the beginner level workshop. It is also assumed that you have some familiarity with programming, hopefully in javascript, but not a lot of experience is required to understand this workshop.

### Outline for the workshop
Like the beginner workshop, the new features and advanced game programming patterns that are going to be introduced will also be applied by building a small game. The game that you are going to build by following along the workshop will be a clone of the classic arcade game space invaders, and in it we are going to incorporate a game loop, advanced movement, text, sounds, and animations.

### Getting started
Before jumping straight into coding, it is often better to grab some paper and pencil and sketch out an idea of what you are going to build. Let us do that for our game:
- We want a player ship that we can move side to side using the `A` and `D` keys.
- We want to able to shoot lasers using the `W` key
- We want a bunch of enemy ships that slowly move down toward the player
- We want the enemies to randomly shoot their own lasers at the player
- We also want to incorporate animations and sound effects into the game.

### Getting the basic structure down
